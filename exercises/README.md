# CKA Exercises

31 hands-on labs covering all seven CKA exam domains. Each one has a task list, hints (use them — they save time), verification commands, and a full solution behind a spoiler tag.

I ordered these roughly by difficulty. If you're short on time, prioritize 09 (kubeadm), 11 (troubleshooting), 29 (etcd fix), and 28 (NetworkPolicy) — those cover the highest-weight domains and represent real exam patterns.

**New in v2.0:** Exercises 23-31 based on 2026 real exam feedback. These test advanced scenarios and common failure patterns.

## How to Use

1. Read the exercise description
2. Try the tasks without looking at the solution
3. Use the hints if you're stuck
4. Check your work with the verification steps
5. Compare against the solution
6. Run cleanup before moving to the next exercise

Every exercise assumes you have a running cluster (kind, minikube, or kubeadm) and the aliases from [`scripts/exam-setup.sh`](../scripts/exam-setup.sh).
